        <h1>hi.</h1>
        <h2>i'm inyourwalls.</h2>

        <h3><br>about me.</h3>
        <p>
            i'm a canadian girl who loves playing with computers. i'm mainly interested in coding/system administration,
            but i also enjoy tinkering with hardware. i've found a lot of fun in trying to run servers on various random machines.
        </p>
        <h3><br>what kind of stuff do i make?</h3>
        <p>
            i play minecraft, so naturally i've gravitated to making plugins/mods. my mod development experience is still fairly limited,
            but i've been getting into plugins. i typically develop plugins for the <a href="https://velocitypowered.com/">Velocity</a> proxy,
            and <a href="https://papermc.io/">Paper</a> servers. outside of minecraft, i've been lightly interested in web development, as well
            creating some fully standalone network programs (like a chat app, for example).
        </p>
        <h3><br>what are you learning?</h3>
        <p>
            the languages i've been learning are <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, <a href="https://java.com/">Java</a>,
            and <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>. outside of just programming languages, i've been working with
            <a href="https://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for some of my more complex projects.
            <br>
            <br>other than that, i've spent a while learning linux, including switching to it as my daily driver (if you're wondering,
            i use <a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> on my desktop, and <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch (btw)</a> on my laptop).
            i've set up a few machines to run servers. outside of linux, i've tried a few other operating systems beyond windows.
            i have briefly used <a href="https://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="https://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
            the former as a desktop OS (although i didn't get very far in setting it up), but i've only briefly played around with the latter in VMs.
        </p>
        <h3><br>okay, where can i find your work?</h3>
        <p>
            i've stopped putting my ongoing projects in public repositories lately, but you can check my <a href="https://github.com/InYourWalls">GitHub</a>.
            at the time of writing, the only thing that's public is a rust library crate i made a long time ago that just wraps a standard library function.
        </p>
        <h3><br>what do you do besides computer science-y stuff?</h3>
        <p>
            i play video games. my all-time favourites are (in no particular order):
            <ul>
                <li>minecraft (a classic)</li>
                <li>terraria (probably the best multiplayer experience)</li>
                <li>kerbal space program (i like airplanes)</li>
                <li>celeste (awesome)</li>
                <li>omori (i like psychological horror)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            outside of video games, i enjoy music. my favourite genre is probably rock, but i will listen to anything. i can play drums and violin,
            and have been learning the guitar.
