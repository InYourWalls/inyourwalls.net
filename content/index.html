        <h2><br>hi, i'm inyourwalls.</h2>

        <h3><br>who am i?</h3>
        <p>
            i'm a canadian girl who likes computers, dogs, and hamburgers.
            i hate hot weather (anything above ~20Â°C is hot to me), transphobia,
            and denji from chainsaw man.
        </p>

        <h3><br>what do i do?</h3>
        <p>
            i write code, sometimes. i'm comfortable with java, kotlin, and rust.
            i'm learning to make mods and plugins for minecraft, primarily.
            i typically use fabric or quilt for modding (most of my mods are client-side),
            and i use spigot/paper and velocity for server plugins.
            <br><br>
            outside of programming, i also play video games. some of my favourites are - in no particular order: 
            minecraft, terraria, omori, celeste, and kerbal space program.
            <br><br>
            i also enjoy music. i can play the drums and violin, and want to learn the guitar.
        </p>

        <h3><br>where do i keep my work?</h3>
        <p>
            while i don't publicly share a lot of my projects, 
            you can check my <a href="https://github.com/InYourWalls">github</a>.
